# orcid-error

I have added 4 images in the repo,

The following points describe every image

1. We have to go to login route for loggining
2. Then we will be redirected to the orcid app
3. Then we will be sent back to our website, where the console log is shown in the sceeenshot. The details are coming as undefined and with a lot of errors
4. The console log in the backend, where details are coming


Please share a example where the orcid-oauth is implimented and please also recommend a package for the same, currently we are using passport.js
